# Excel - Challenge 1
Background

Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been growing in success and popularity since the late 2000s. From independent content creators to famous celebrities, more and more people are using crowdfunding to launch new products and generate buzz, but not every project has found success.
To receive funding, the project must meet or exceed an initial goal, so many organizations dedicate considerable resources looking through old projects in an attempt to discover “the trick” to finding success. For this week's Challenge, you will organize and analyze a database of 1,000 sample projects to uncover any hidden trends.


Project Overview

Data Analysis and Visualization
Data Overview: Analyze the sample-project data provided in the Excel workbook to uncover market trends. This dataset, generated by edX Boot Camps LLC, is for educational purposes.
Conditional Formatting:
Apply conditional formatting to the outcome column to color-code based on campaign status: successful, failed, canceled, or live.
Apply a three-color scale to the Percent Funded column: dark red for 0%, green for 100%, and blue for 200%.
Data Transformation:
Create a Percent Funded column to calculate the percentage of the funding goal achieved.
Create an Average Donation column to determine the average amount donated per backer.
Split the Category column into Parent Category and Sub-Category columns.
Pivot Tables and Charts
Category Analysis:
Create a pivot table to count campaigns by status (successful, failed, canceled, live) per category.
Generate a stacked-column pivot chart filtered by country.
Subcategory Analysis:
Create a pivot table to count campaigns by status per sub-category.
Generate a stacked-column pivot chart filtered by country and parent category.
Date Conversion:
Convert launched_at and deadline Unix timestamps to Excel date format in Date Created Conversion and Date Ended Conversion columns.
Outcomes by Launch Date:
Create a pivot table with outcomes and launch dates, and a pivot-chart line graph to visualize this data.
Reporting
Microsoft Word Report:
Provide insights on crowdfunding campaigns, dataset limitations, and potential additional analyses.
Crowdfunding Goal Analysis
Goal-Based Statistics:
Create a sheet with columns for project goals, successful, failed, canceled counts, and percentages.
Analyze and graph the relationship between funding goals and campaign outcomes.
Statistical Analysis
Campaign Backers:
Create a summary table for the number of backers in successful vs. unsuccessful campaigns.
Calculate and compare mean, median, minimum, maximum, variance, and standard deviation for both categories.
Analyze whether mean or median better represents the data and assess variability in campaign success.
